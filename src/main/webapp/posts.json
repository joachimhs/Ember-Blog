Is determining the overall state of the application hard to figure out, and generally a mess to debug ? Does your GUI tend to show the wrong panels, have overlapping panels and in general have recurring bugs with its state ? Then Statecharts are the way to go to achieve a cleaner, testable and less error-prone GUI.",
